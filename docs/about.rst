*SBEMimage* is an open-source Python application to run acquisitions with scanning electron microscopes, in particular for serial block-face imaging. It was initially developed at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research. Read the `paper <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00054/abstract>`_ describing the software.

The current version is 2020.07. Lead developer: Benjamin Titze (`btitze <https://github.com/btitze>`_, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland; MagC wafer acquisition functionality was developed by Thomas Templier, Janelia Research Campus; other contributors: https://github.com/SBEMimage/SBEMimage/graphs/contributors

The development of *SBEMimage* at the Friedrich Miescher Institute has been supported by the Novartis Research Foundation and by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreement No. 742576).

Other institutes that have substantially contributed to *SBEMimage* development/testing: EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland (CIME/BioEM); Francis Crick Institute, London, UK.
