class Microtome_3View(Microtome):
    """
    This class contains the methods to control a 3View microtome via
    DigitalMicrograph (DM).
    The DM script SBEMimage_DMcom_GMS2.s (or SBEMimage_DMcom_GMS3.s for GMS3)
    must be running in DM to receive commands from SBEMimage and transmit them
    to the 3View hardware (XY stage and knife arm).
    Communication with DM is achieved by read/write file operations.
    The following files are used:
      DMcom.in:   Command/parameter file. Contains a command and up to
                  two optional parameters.
      DMcom.cmd:  The file 'DMcom.in' is renamed to 'DMcom.cmd' to trigger
                  its contents to be processed by DM.
      DMcom.out:  Contains return value(s) from DM
      DMcom.ack:  Confirms that a command has been received and processed.
      DMcom.ac2:  Confirms that a full cut cycle has been completed.
      DMcom.wng:  Signals a warning (a problem occurred, but could be resolved).
      DMcom.err:  Signals that a critical error occured.

    The 3View knife parameters (knife speeds, osciallation on/off) cannot be
    changed remotely via SBEMimage; they must be set in DM before the
    acquisition starts. The pre-acquisition dialog box asks the user
    to ensure these settings match the DM settings (for logging purposes).
